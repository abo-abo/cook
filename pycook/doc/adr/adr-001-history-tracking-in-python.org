* Decision
The per-REPL history should be tracked in Python.

* Rationale
** Setting up multiple REPLs via pycook is easy
In file:~/.cook.d/psql.py:
#+begin_src python
def db1(recipe):
    return "psql postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db"

def db2(recipe):
    ...

def prod(recipe, db=["db1","db2"]):
    if db == "db1":
        return
    elif ...
#+end_src
The REPL in Emacs shall be named something like =*compile psql db1*=.

Since each database holds different tables, it's good for each REPL to have its own
history.

* Implementation details
The history files are stored in file:~/.cook.d/history/.
Each command is separated by "\n--\n", so that they can be multiline.
