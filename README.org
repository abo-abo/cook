* Introduction
The traditional =Makefile= is replaced by =Cookbook.py=. Use =cook= in place
of =make=.

This results in a lot of flexibility, because the new "Makefile" is
scripted in a full-featured language - Python.

- Recipe :: the equivalent of a Makefile's rule
  - A Python function that takes a single argument called =recipe= and
    returns a vector of strings - a sequence of commands to run.

* Installing
Install system-wide:
#+begin_src sh
sudo -H pip3 --no-cache-dir install --upgrade pycook
#+end_src

To hook up bash completion for =cook=, add to your
=~/.bashrc=:
#+begin_src sh
. /usr/local/cook/bash-completion.sh
#+end_src

* Running recipes
You can run the recipes with =cook <recipe>=.

Minimal =Cookbook.py= example:
#+begin_src python
#* Recipes
def files_in_dir(recipe):
    return ["ls"]

def files_in_parent_dir(recipe):
    res = ["cd .."]
    res += ["find ."]
    return res

def last_commit(recipe):
    return ["git rev-parse HEAD"]
#+end_src

Runing e.g.:
#+begin_src sh
cook files_in_dir
#+end_src

will call:
#+begin_src python
from Cookbook import *
bash(files_in_dir(42))
#+end_src

* Automatic logging
=cook= can automatically log your =stdout= to a file with a
timestamped name in a location you specify.

To make use of this, create a file =~/.cookrc.py= with the following
contents:

#+begin_src python
config = {
    "*": {
        "tee": {
            "location": "/tmp/cook"
        }
    }
}
#+end_src

Here, the inital ="*"= is used to select all books. It's possible to
customize each book separately by using the file name as a key.

* Elisp completion
It's actually much more convenient to use =cook= from Emacs.

The main advantage is that Emacs will find the appropriate cookbook
from anywhere in the project.

The secondary advantages are:
- better completion for recipe selection
- the selected recipe is run in =compilation-mode=, which connects any
  errors or warings to locations in a project.
- the selected recipe is run in a buffer named after the recipe
- works with TRAMP, so the recipes from remote cookbooks will be run
  remotely.

~M-x cook~ will:

- go recursively up from the current directory until a cookbook is
  found
- parse the cookbook for recipes
- offer the list of recipes
- run the seleted recipe in =compilation-mode=

I'm using this binding:
#+begin_src elisp
(global-set-key [f6] 'cook)
#+end_src
